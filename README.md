# Hetionet EDA — Drug Repositioning Knowledge Graph Analysis

Exploratory data analysis of **Hetionet v1.0**, a biomedical knowledge graph connecting
drugs, genes, and diseases. The goal is to characterise graph structure, enumerate
metapath features, and establish a rigorous baseline for the
**Compound-treats-Disease (CtD)** link-prediction task (drug repositioning).

This EDA is designed to the standard of a professional data science project:
full English, no redundant visualisations, and analysis that directly informs
downstream modelling decisions.

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`01_overview.ipynb`](eda/01_overview.ipynb) | Dataset validation, node/edge type distributions, class-imbalance analysis |
| [`02_structure.ipynb`](eda/02_structure.ipynb) | Degree distribution (power-law fit), connectivity, shortest paths, centrality |
| [`03_compound_disease.ipynb`](eda/03_compound_disease.ipynb) | CtD/CpD sparsity, metapath enumeration, DWPC feature baseline, OWA analysis, negative-sampling design |

Run them in order — each notebook depends on outputs described (but not re-computed) by the previous one.

## Key Findings

| Finding | Value |
|---|---|
| Nodes / Edges | 47,031 / 2,250,197 |
| Node-type imbalance | 152.9× (Gene vs. Disease) |
| CtD density | 0.36% (755 edges) |
| Giant component (core subgraph) | 88% of nodes, mean path length 2.80 |
| CbG–GaD metapath CtD recall | ~73% with 36× coverage lift |
| UBC betweenness | 0.34 (next: 0.026) — hub correction mandatory |

## Setup

### 1. Get the data

Hetionet v1.0 is publicly available from the [Hetionet repository](https://github.com/hetio/hetionet).
Download the compressed JSON and place it at the path expected by `utils.py`:

```bash
# From the project root
mkdir -p hetionet-main/hetnet/json
curl -L "https://github.com/hetio/hetionet/raw/main/hetnet/json/hetionet-v1.0.json.bz2" \
     -o hetionet-main/hetnet/json/hetionet-v1.0.json.bz2
```

Alternatively, set the `HETIONET_PATH` environment variable to point to the file directly:

```bash
export HETIONET_PATH=/path/to/hetionet-v1.0.json.bz2
```

### 2. Install dependencies

This project uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) for environment management.

```bash
# Install pixi (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# From the eda/ directory
cd eda
pixi install
```

> **Other platforms**: `pixi.toml` targets `osx-arm64`. Linux/Windows users can install
> dependencies manually via pip:
> ```bash
> pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn networkx scipy scikit-learn tqdm
> ```

### 3. Launch Jupyter

```bash
cd eda
pixi run notebook
# or: jupyter notebook
```
